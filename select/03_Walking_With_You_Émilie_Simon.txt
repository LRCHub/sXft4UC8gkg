Just woke up
You're still in my head
You were here with me
And I don't feel alone
No I don't fell alone

Just woke up
I'm stronger today
There's not looking back
And I don't want to cry
No I don't want to cry

Oh Oh Oh
I've been walking with you
I've been dreaming with you
I've been flying
I've been flying
Through the night with you

Just woke up
And I'm looking straight ahead
If it came around again
I'd do everything the same
Never give a second thought

Never give a second thought
Oh Oh Oh
I've been Walking with you
I've been dreaming with you
I've been flying
Throught the night with you
