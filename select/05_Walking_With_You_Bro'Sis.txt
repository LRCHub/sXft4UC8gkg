What a day, wanna know? - What a night, to

A day and night can seem so long - when

Walking with you (oh no), and talking with
you (oh no) - for a thousand years, across
a thousand miles - you're my best friend (oh
no), yeah yeah (oh no) - and laughing with

love you back

It's ok, to rely, on me - depend on me - I'll be
more than what you're looking for

I wanna run and turn to you - believe in me
I'll only speak the truth - another day,
another night (oh no) - 'cause you and me we
are the same - it's gonna work there's no-

Walking with you (oh no), and talking with
you (oh no) - for a thousand years, across
a thousand miles - you're my best friend (oh
no), yeah yeah (oh no) - and laughing with
you, and crying with you - with a thousand
tears, to have a thousand smiles

All of the troubles I've past (past) - I've done
it for you - for this day when we join
(comin' at cha.) - and all of the people I've
known - they know about you - like you said.

time, that we've spent - lonely at night (lone-
ly at night) - and all of the promises then,

a thousand miles - you're my best friend (oh

tell this old story - I'll be walking with you -
and crying with you (crying with you) - and
