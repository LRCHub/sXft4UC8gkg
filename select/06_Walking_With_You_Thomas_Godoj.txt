Down
Down by the sea
where we once started
That's where I'll be
Spring
Beauty and fall
Old man winter is not
Gonna move me at all
I still hear you breathing
With your lips on my ear
As summer is leaving
Now I'm walking on water
Walking with you
Now I'm walking on water
Walking with you
They
Carved it in stone
Now a good man
Is on his way home
But you go
And tell everyone
That I'm still singing your songs
Now I still see you walking
Down where we once left.
I'll wait here for ever.
Now I'm walking on water
Walking with you
Now I'm walking on water
Walking with you
Someday we'll be walking
Together again
That's when you tell me
Now I'm walking on water
Walking with you
Now I'm walking on water
Walking with you
