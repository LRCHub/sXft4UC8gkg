[00:00.23] Countless thoughts
[00:05.38] Right now, I'll shout so you can hear me
[00:21.32] At some point, everything reflected in those eyes
[00:26.79] As if looking into a darkness without light
[00:42.05] When I was trembling with sorrow and about to run away
[00:47.57] Your words saved me.
[00:53.09] The self reflected in the mirror gradually, gradually
[00:58.97] It changes as if by magic,
[01:03.19] Her smile remains as innocent as ever.
[01:07.73] Because I want to watch you
[01:13.22] Countless thoughts
[01:18.40] I'll keep on giving forever Long, long into the future
[01:23.34] I swear to myself over and over
[01:28.67] Hold my hand and stay by my side forever And I'll never let go
[01:53.50] I make up self mind that I'm just keeping to go my chose way from now on
[01:59.99] Somebody cannot stop me no matter what you said, no matter what you thought
[02:05.44] When my heart feels like it's about to break And I'm tempted to give up
[02:10.59] Without saying a word, he just held me close.
[02:15.94] Sometimes your words are unreasonable
[02:21.75] There are moments that make me feel irritated,
[02:26.09] I love you so much, I want to protect you with my own hands.
[02:36.29] I want to watch the changing seasons with you, with my own eyes.
[02:41.30] I could love any color
[02:49.14] Let's seize that picture-perfect happiness
[02:58.46] Even 50 years from now, surely
[03:03.78] Without even realizing it, I've found the meaning of happiness.
[03:08.69] Far more than anyone else in the world
[03:13.78] I want to keep walking forward with you, just the two of us, oh
[03:23.31] With you, like a shining star, Countless wishes
[03:34.73] We can make it happen, no matter what Over and over, forever We can do it
